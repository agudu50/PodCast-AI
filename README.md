# What's PodcastAI ?

**Podcast AI** is a web-based platform designed to help podcasters and content creators repurpose their content effortlessly. By leveraging the power of AI, the platform transcribes podcast episodes into text, generates summaries and highlights, and automates sharing across social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and personal blogs.  

Our goal is to make podcast content more accessible, engaging, and shareable, while saving creators valuable time.
